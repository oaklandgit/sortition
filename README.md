## What is Sortion?

Sortition is a democratic system where public officials or decision-makers are chosen randomly rather than being elected. It’s used as an alternative to representative democracy to reduce the influence of money, popularity contests, and party politics, aiming instead for a body that statistically reflects the population’s diversity.

Or as I like to say: **"Government by the People, Governed by the People."**
